I used to think leadership in a design lab meant having all the answers. Now I know it means being willing to change the question.

When we first started ASEN 2804, I was excited to lead. I had the spreadsheet open, the deadlines noted, and the vision of a water rocket soaring cleanly from launch to glide, powered by a perfect thrust curve and equations that made sense on the first try. That was the dream.

What followed was something messier—and much more meaningful.

As the team leader, I quickly realized I wasn’t just managing a schedule or overseeing code. I was navigating uncertainty. Guiding people through incomplete data sets, conflicting models, and the slow realization that no one—not even the instructors—could hand us a definitive path. It had to be carved, adjusted, sometimes scrapped, and rebuilt entirely.

We ran static tests that produced noisy data and thrust profiles that didn’t behave. We tried fitting them to third-order polynomials like the workshop suggested, but sometimes the model felt more like guesswork than engineering. I watched our team wrestle with those fits—some wanting to make the math cleaner, others wanting to move on. I had to remind them, and myself, that a less-than-perfect fit wasn’t failure—it was a lesson in the limits of modeling.

Somewhere in the middle of this chaos, I stopped seeing this as just a class. I saw it as a proving ground—not for the rocket, but for us. For how we handle ambiguity. For how we respond when our “ideal configuration” doesn’t reach apogee. Whether we can say, “This isn’t working. Let’s pivot.”

I said that more than once. I had to.

There’s a strange pressure in projects like this to finish what you start, no matter what. To stick with the original design, the original code, the original assumptions, just to say we were “consistent.” But consistency isn’t the goal. Soul is.

Some of our best progress came when we let go of a flight path, a stability model, and a drag estimate, and followed curiosity instead. I watched teammates light up when we finally got the boost-glide transition to behave in the simulation, or when someone cracked a better wing geometry model after throwing out the one we’d been clinging to. Those moments weren’t about completion. They were about alignment—with the project, with ourselves.

I learned that leadership sometimes means protecting space for change. It’s okay if we switched the Oswald efficiency models three times. That walking away from a path isn’t quitting—it’s maturing. It’s saying, “We’re not here to prove we're right. We’re here to find what’s true.”

We built a boost-glide vehicle. We modeled weight, thrust, flight dynamics, and stability. But what I’m most proud of is that we built a team that wasn’t afraid to change course.

If I had to do it again, I wouldn’t aim for perfection. I’d aim for resonance. For building something that wants to fly, not just because it’s aerodynamic, but because it’s honest.

So if we flaked a bit along the way, I’m okay with that. We flaked it till we made it—and maybe, that’s the real trajectory that mattered.
