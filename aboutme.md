Hey there — welcome to my digital corner of the universe. This page is where you get to learn a bit more about *who I am*, *what I care about*, and *why aerospace isn't just my major — it's my mission*.

## 👨‍🚀 Who Am I?

Hi! I’m **Abhishek Siwakoti**, a student of Aerospace Engineering with a passion for turning the impossible into equations, CAD files, and flying prototypes.

**Quick intro snapshot**:  
🛰️ School: University of Colorado Boulder  

🚀 Focus areas: Orbital Dynamics, Aircraft Stability, Aerodynamics, and Thermodynamics  

🔧 Tools I love: MATLAB, Python, Simulink, SolidWorks, Git, LaTeX

🧠 I geek out about:  
  - The Kármán line (yes, it *is* arbitrary but still cool)  
  - Supersonic shockwaves and Prandtl–Meyer expansions  
  - Lagrange points and how they create "gravitational parking spots"  
  - Thrust vector control in rockets  
  - The elegance of the Breguet range equation  
  - Turbulence... even if no one fully understands it

## ✈️ Why Aerospace?

{: .box-warning}
Everyone’s got a spark. Mine? Watching rockets lift off and realizing *someone* built that — someone like me, one day.

I fell in love with flight, space, and engineering the moment I realized that physics + creativity = aerospace.

I was born in Nepal — not in a hospital, but with heart and grit already installed.  
Coming to the U.S. young, I didn’t arrive with much. But what I *did* bring was the belief that struggle can shape precision, and that dreams don’t have to start polished to end up soaring.

Engineering didn’t just speak to me — it **challenged** me. And I’ve been answering back ever since.

What started as helping my mom, fixing things around the house, and launching makeshift gadgets, turned into launching actual rockets in class and modeling flight paths in MATLAB. I realized that engineering isn't just about solving equations — it's about solving life, one problem at a time.

I’ve built trebuchets that can launch beanbags 50 feet, CAD models that print to spec, and I’m on my way to building a life that can lift others too.


Every class, every late night, every build that fails forward — it all comes back to this:  
**Make something better than what you were handed.**

## 🧠 My Engineering Philosophy

> If it has my name on it, I want it done right — whether it’s a flight sim, a design file, or the code behind this website. I can’t promise perfection, but I can promise I’ll give it everything I’ve got.

I believe in:
  - Simplicity that scales
  - Documentation that lives
  - Code that doesn’t bite back

| VR Roller Coaster G-Force Simulator (ASEN 2803 Lab 1) | MATLAB, G-force math, plotting | Built a coaster sim that modeled safe human acceleration |
| Locomotive Crank Motion (ASEN 2803 Lab 2) | MATLAB, sensors, data analysis | Validated kinematics with real-world encoder + potentiometer data |
| Rotary Arm PD Control (ASEN 2803 Lab 3) | MATLAB, Simulink, strain gauges | Tuned a PD controller and modeled 2-DOF dynamics with feedback |

## 🎬 If My Life Were a Movie...

It would be [*Everything Everywhere All at Once*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everywhere_All_at_Once): chaotic, beautiful, emotional, and oddly philosophical — with googly eyes, multiverse jumps, and yes... **Raccacooniee**. 🦝👨‍🍳

There’s something about embracing the mess of life while still choosing kindness and purpose that just resonates.  
Plus, if I could bend space and time, I'd go live with raccacoonie.

*Pro tip:* If you made it this far, we should totally be working on a mission together someday.
