<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1em;">👋 Who Am I?</h2>

<p style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.6;">
  My name is <strong>Abhishek Siwakoti</strong>, and I’m currently pursuing Aerospace Engineering — because, well, someone has to build the future of spaceflight, right?
</p>

<p style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.6;">
  Here are a few things that define me:
</p>

<ul style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
  <li>✨ I love stargazing and the cosmos — it’s what pulled me into Aerospace Engineering in the first place.</li>
  <li>🛡️ I'm fiercely loyal to my family and friends. Loyalty matters more than thrust-to-weight ratios (barely).</li>
  <li>📐 I can model a glide path, write a controller, or debug code... and still be on time for dinner.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2em;">🎬 My Story</h3>

<p style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.6;">
  Honestly, I could try to summarize it here — but why not let cinema do the talking? If you really want to understand me, you should probably just watch 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29" target="_blank"><strong>my movie</strong></a>. It answers <em>everything</em>.
