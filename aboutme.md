Hey there — welcome to my digital corner of the universe. This page is where you get to learn a bit more about *who I am*, *what I care about*, and *why aerospace isn't just my major — it's my mission*.

## 👨‍🚀 Who Am I?

Hi! I’m **Abhishek Siwakoti**, a student of Aerospace Engineering with a passion for turning the impossible into equations, CAD files, and flying prototypes.

**Quick intro snapshot**:  
- 🛰️ School: `{{ your university name }}`
- 🚀 Focus areas: `{{ your interests (e.g., orbital dynamics, controls, UAVs) }}`
- 🧠 I geek out about: `{{ aerospace concepts, hobbies, tech stuff }}`
- 🔧 Tools I love: `{{ MATLAB, SolidWorks, Python, etc. }}`

## ✈️ Why Aerospace?

{: .box-warning}
Everyone’s got a spark. Mine? Watching rockets lift off and realizing *someone* built that — someone like me, one day.

I fell in love with flight, space, and engineering the moment I realized that physics + creativity = aerospace.

Add your story here:  
`{{ What inspired you to go into aerospace? A teacher? A movie? A project? }}`

## 🧠 My Engineering Philosophy

> "*Test it. Break it. Learn from it. Rebuild better.*" — me, after many late nights.

I believe in:
- Simplicity that scales
- Documentation that lives
- Code that doesn’t bite back

List a few personal engineering rules or philosophies here if you'd like!

| Project | Tools Used | Coolest Outcome |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| `{{ Project name }}` | `{{ MATLAB, Arduino }}` | `{{ Real result (e.g., "tracked a rocket arc!") }}` |
| `{{ Another one }}` | `{{ Python, SolidWorks }}` | `{{ "Printed my first working airfoil" }}` |
| `{{ One more? }}` | `{{ Simulink, sensors }}` | `{{ "Reduced overshoot to under 5%" }}` |

## 🎬 If My Life Were a Movie...

It would be **[The Princess Bride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29)**: a mix of wonder, wit, and sword fights (okay maybe not the last one... yet).

You can replace this with your favorite movie or fun metaphor for your life/journey.

## 😻 Meet My Cat

> Life’s better with an aerospace assistant who sheds on your schematics.

**Name:** `{{ your cat's name }}`  
**Specialty:** Napping through lectures and walking across my keyboard mid-CAD.  
![Cat](https://placekitten.com/600/400)  
*Yes, you can replace that image link with your own.*

*Pro tip:* If you made it this far — we should totally be working on a mission together someday.
